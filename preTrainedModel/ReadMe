This directory includes some pre-trained models.

-- car:  different models presented in our ECCV2014 paper, "Integrating Context and Occlusion for Car Detection by Hierarchical And-Or Model".

         Parking_Lot Dataset: please download it from http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~tfwu/publication/parking_lot_release.zip
         Street_Parking Dataset: please download it from http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~tfwu/publication/street-parking-release.zip

-- voc2007_RGM: models presented in our CVPR2013 paper, "Discriminatively Trained And-Or Tree Model for Object Detection".
                              Note: these models did not train bounding box prediction model. 

All these pretrained models are just for demostration. The training code will be release soon.
